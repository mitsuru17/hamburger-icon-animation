CSS Animated Hamburger Icon
========================

Today is raining in Italy so I thought it would be fun to build an animated hamburger icon and to teach you how to do it.

## Build the hamburger icon using CSS

I know, many of you use a font or an image to represent the hamburger icon but we can create it only using HTML and CSS. Yeyyy! 

Firstly we need to write down our markup:

```
<a class="menu" href="javascript:;">
	<span class="bar1"></span>
	<span class="bar2"></span>
	<span class="bar3"></span>
</a>
```
